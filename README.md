## Things to know
<b>To get Fenvi T919 working, you'll need to do some trickery as Apple dropped support for Broadcom cards since Sonoma. There are multiple guides online, I found [this one](https://github.com/perez987/Fenvi-T919-wifi-back-on-macOS-Sonoma-with-OCLP) the most useful</b><br><br>
<b>Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate a serial number and a MLB (motherboard serial number) for MacPro7,1. In the config.plist the entries of the serial number and MLB are empty! You'll also need to generate the System-UUID and the ROM in SMBIOS, I recommend generating it with [OCAT](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools)</b><br><br>
<b>With AMD CPUs, a lot of applications will crash or won't function properly, that's due to MKL, to fix this, I highly recommend [amdfriend](https://github.com/NyaomiDEV/AMDFriend) to fix these issues!</b><br><br>
If Handoff or Universal Clipboard don't work, check out my guide in the 'handoff-fix' folder!

## What works
âœ… Ethernet + WiFi + Bluetooth => AirDrop, Handoff, iMessage/FaceTime <br>
âœ… Graphics Acceleration (RX 5700 XT is natively supported)<br>
âœ… AMD Power Management<br>
âœ… Sleep mode<br>
âœ… All audio ports (front and rear speaker/mic ports, HDMI/DP audio) => Boot Chime<br>
âœ… USB ports<br>

## Doesn't work
ðŸ«¢ Well, everything works!
